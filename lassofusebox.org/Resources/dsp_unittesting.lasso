Unfortunately we're not perfect whichis why we can make use of unit testing our fuses. The concept of unit testing a fuseis to validate whether it works on it's own. Not only does it run on its own, but does it also producethe desired output?<p>This is another reason why Fusedocs are so powerful. The important part of Fusedocs is the <nobr>&lt;io&gt;</nobr> section.This area tells us what variables the fuse will be given and what variables the fuse needs to create.<p>For example, it's possible to test a display fuse without a database. Even if the display fuse is displayingrecords from the database. All we need to know are what <nobr>&lt;in&gt;</nobr> variables the fuse will be given. If the fusewill be given a recordset, we simply need to simulate that incoming recordset so we can see what happenswhen that data comes in. <p>This is the case for any incoming variable. We can fake each incoming variable to simulate how the fusewill react to different incoming variables. As a tester we need to make a decision whether it's reactingproperly or not.<p>This where the <nobr>&lt;out&gt;</nobr> variables come into play. Using fusedocs it's possible to validate whetherthe data being produced by the fuse matches up with the necessary <nobr>&lt;out&gt;</nobr>data in the fusedoc. <p>Once the fusedocs have been tested to produce the desired output according to the fusedoc, the architect plugs the fuses back into the fuseactions.<br><br><h2>Tools</h2><p>Coming Soon<br>To help develop new Lasso Fusebox tools please contact us.</p>		</td>	</tr></table>
